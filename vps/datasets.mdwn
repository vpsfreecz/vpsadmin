# Storage layout
Private areas of all VPSes are stored in datasets on the hypervisor node in pool
with role `hypervisor`. Furthermore, to utilize more ZFS features,
it is possible to create subdatasets and set their properties individually.

Private area is not stored in the VPS dataset directly. Due to the behaviour
of `vzctl`, which does not support ZFS currently, it must be stored in subdirectory
`private`. That is because `vzctl` expects to work with a directory, not a dataset.

The dataset structure by default looks as follows:

 - vz/private
   - 101
     - directory private/
     - ..subdatasets..
   - 102
     - directory private/
     - ..subdatasets..
   - ...

# Subdatasets
Subdataset for a VPS differ from ordinal subdatasets. Its creation and rollback must
consider the fact that a system runs on top of it.

When creating a subdataset, its mountpoint must be set correctly
to `/vz/root/<veid>/<path>`, otherwise it would not be accessible from inside the VPS.

Rollback of a dataset works as usual, except that before the datasets are switched
(old with the rollbacked one), or before `zfs rollback` is called, the VPS must be stopped
and then started again, if it was running before the rollback. The VPS must be stopped even
when rollbacking a subdataset, because a process from the VPS might be working with the data,
making the dataset busy.
