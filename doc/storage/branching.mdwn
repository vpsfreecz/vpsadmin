# The purpose of branching
Branching allows a dataset to be backed up with the capability to rollback
to a specified snapshot and recover from history flow interruption.

Branched datasets do not contain data directly. They contain `tree`
datasets. Inside `trees` are `branches`.

Trees are needed when the history flow of snapshots is broken. That happens
when the snapshot from `primary` or `hypervisor` pool is lost or when the common
snapshot between the two datasets has been destroyed. Currently,
this happens only for VPS reinstall. In case of history flow interruption,
new tree is created and new snapshots are transfered there.

Branches are inside trees. They are needed for the rollback operation, which
is explained below. The history flow in a tree is never broken.

# Naming conventions
Every dataset in a pool with `backup` role has at least one tree and every
tree has at least one branch.

Tree datasets are named as `tree.<index>` where index is an incrementing
number starting at 0.
Branch name is a snapshot name that the branch was created from. The first branch
is named simply by date and time of its creation.

Branch names have a prefix _branch_ and a suffix to index datasets of the same
name that might be created when restoring from one dataset more than once.

# Head
vpsAdmin remembers which tree is the head of a dataset and which branch inside
that tree is the head. New snapshots are always sent to the head. The head
changes only during rollback or history flow interruption.

# Examples
Suppose there is a pool with root dataset ``storage/backup`` and dataset
``101`` (which is a private area of a VPS) is backed up daily.

The backups would look like:

 - storage/backup/101
   - tree.0
     - branch-2014-01-01--00:00:00.0
         - @2014-01-01--00:00:00
         - @2014-01-02--00:00:00
         - @2014-01-03--00:00:00

An example with nested datasets:

 - storage/backup/101
   - tree.0
     - branch-2014-01-01--00:00:00.0
         - @2014-01-01--00:00:00
         - @2014-01-02--00:00:00
         - @2014-01-03--00:00:00
   - nested-dataset
     - tree.0
         - branch-2014-01-01--00:00:00.0
             - @2014-01-01--00:00:00
             - @2014-01-02--00:00:00
             - @2014-01-03--00:00:00

In the examples above, there are three daily backups and both datasets have
only one brach, as there was no rollback yet.

## Rollback
Rollback is why branches are needed. When rolling back, the snapshot to rollback
to is cloned into a new dataset. The clone is then promoted and dataset head
is set to the clone. On the other hand, if the target snapshot is on top
of a branch, it is rollbacked on the hypervisor only.

Let's assume there are five backups of VPS #101:

 - storage/backup/101
   - tree.0
     - branch-2014-01-01--01:00:00.0
         - @2014-01-01--01:00:00
         - @2014-01-02--01:00:00
         - @2014-01-03--01:00:00
         - @2014-01-04--01:00:00
         - @2014-01-05--01:00:00

Now the user wants to rollback to 2014-01-03--01:00:00. Snapshot
``storage/backup/101/tree.0/branch-2014-01-01--01:00:00.0@@2014-01-03--01:00:00``
is cloned to ``storage/backup/101/tree.0/branch-2014-01-03--01:00:00.0`` and promoted.
The promotion causes the datasets older or equal to the one rollbacking to
to move to the clone.

At the same time, on a pool with the _hypervisor_ role, the dataset ``101``
is rollbacked also. There is no branching present on a _hypervisor_
and all history is kept only on _backup_. If there are snapshots
on the _hypervisor_ that are not yet present on the _backup_, they must
be transfered before the rollback.

The branches then look like this:

 - storage/vpsfree.cz/backup/101
   - tree.0
     - branch-2014-01-01--01:00:00.0
         - @2014-01-04--01:00:00
         - @2014-01-05--01:00:00
     - branch-2014-01-03-01:00:00.0
         - @2014-01-01--01:00:00
         - @2014-01-02--01:00:00
         - @2014-01-03--01:00:00
	 
Note that because of the clone there is a dependency between dataset
``storage/backup/101/tree.0/branch-2014-01-01--01:00:00.0`` and snapshot
``storage/backup/101/tree.0/branch-2014-01-03-01:00:00.0@2014-01-03--01:00:00``.
The snapshot cannot be deleted first. It has to be kept until the dependent
dataset is destroyed.

The tree head is set to ``branch-2014-01-03-01:00:00.0``. New snapshots are
sent there:

 - storage/vpsfree.cz/backup/101
   - tree.0
     - branch-2014-01-01--01:00:00.0
         - @2014-01-04--01:00:00
         - @2014-01-05--01:00:00
     - branch-2014-01-03-01:00:00.0
         - @2014-01-01--01:00:00
         - @2014-01-02--01:00:00
         - @2014-01-03--01:00:00
         - @2014-01-06--01:00:00
         - @2014-01-07--01:00:00
         - @2014-01-08--01:00:00

# History flow interruption
When the dataset on `primary` or `hypervisor` pools is destroyed/reset/lost
or the common snapshot is gone,
new tree is created and is set as head for the dataset on `backup`.
New snapshots are then branched and transfered there.

Dataset head changes also during rollback operation, when one rollbacks
to a snapshot from a different tree. The head is then set to the tree
the snapshot comes from. The rollback operation is otherwise performed
as usual.

Snapshots in different trees cannot interact in any way, they are not compatible
with each other, as basically they are snapshots of different datasets.

## Rotation
Continuing the example above, the snapshot rotation is not straightforward.
When there are multiple branches, there are dependencies between them.
vpsAdmin remembers that and must first destroy the dependants, then the
_parents_.

 1. destroy ``@2014-01-01--01:00:00``
 2. destroy ``@2014-01-02--01:00:00``
 3. skip ``@2014-01-03--01:00:00``
 4. destroy ``@2014-01-04--01:00:00``
 5. destroy ``@2014-01-05--01:00:00``
    - branch ``branch-2014-01-01--01:00:00.0`` is empty, destroy it
    - ``@2014-01-03--01:00:00`` has no dependants, destroy it
 6. destroy ``@2014-01-06--01:00:00``
 7. and so on...
 
If the dataset has multiple trees, all snapshots are put together on one heap
and destroyed with the same rules. A tree is destroyed when it's empty.
